Reservationbot
==============

## So, what's this?

It's an exercise. Here are the requirements:

**There is a restaurant that requires a reservation system. The restaurant only has the following characteristics:**

1. Only has 2 tables, a 2-person table and a 4-person table
2. All reservations are 2 hours in length
3. The restaurant is open Monday through Friday 5pm to 10pm.

**Write a system that will accept reservation requests and create them if the business rules are followed.**

## What's it built with?

Love of course. (And [Suspenders](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders))

## Any TODOs?

Always!

1. Refactoring models
2. Extract service objects
3. Refactor specs
4. Something with FactoryGirl, Rspec, or Pg is not acting right. Fix!
5. Delayed job became a casualty of previous point (4)
